## React is one of the most popular frontend JavaScript frameworks.
We just posted a course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you how to build twenty-five different projects using React. Each project is designed to challenge and enhance your understanding of React's capabilities. Sangam Mukherjee developed this course.

## Why React?
React stands out in the web development world for its efficiency, flexibility, and the vast ecosystem it supports. It enables developers to build large web applications that can change data without reloading the page, ensuring a seamless user experience. React's component-based architecture makes it scalable and maintainable, making it a top choice for both startups and established enterprises.
